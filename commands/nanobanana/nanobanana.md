description: Generate and manipulate images with Nano Banana using natural language prompts
argument-hint: <natural language request>
---

Please use the nanobanana MCP server tools to help with image generation and manipulation tasks based on the user's natural language request.

Analyze the user request and determine the most appropriate tool:

- For single/multiple image generation: use generate_image tool
- For editing existing images: use edit_image tool
- For restoring/enhancing images: use restore_image tool
- For app icons, favicons, UI elements: use generate_icon tool
- For seamless patterns, textures, backgrounds: use generate_pattern tool
- For visual stories, sequences, tutorials: use generate_story tool
- For technical diagrams, flowcharts, architecture: use generate_diagram tool

Be intelligent about interpreting the user's intent from their natural language description and select the most specialized tool available.

If the user includes an explicit --filename option, pass it through to the selected tool as the filename parameter.
If the user includes an explicit --files option, parse the comma-separated list into an array (1-14 paths) and pass it as the files parameter to generate_image, generate_icon, generate_pattern, generate_story, or generate_diagram. Files can be absolute paths or relative filenames that will be searched in: current directory, ./images/, ./input/, ./nanobanana-output/, ~/Downloads/, ~/Desktop/. If the request is for edit_image or restore_image, instruct the user to use --file instead of --files.
If the user includes an explicit --parallel option, pass it through to the selected tool as the parallel parameter (1-8, default: 2).
